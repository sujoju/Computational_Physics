PROBLEM 1

For this problem, I chose to animate two standing waves separately; the wave 
numbers (rather the multiples of 2 PI) for these standing waves were 1.5 and 4.

PROBLEM 2

For this problem, I used the same parameters as the book (those being l=1, 
x_0=0.5, Delta x=0.01, and c=300), and I also tracked the amplitude at x=0.05. 
Since the book wanted me to compare the FFT of the pulse when displaced at 
x_0=0.5 and x_0=0.45, I generated the data for both of these via 
assignment4_2.c and assignment4_2_offset.c; furthermore, the data for both was 
also compiled into a gif. I then found the FFT of both sets of data at the 
tracked displacement of x=0.05 via assignment4_2_fft.c and 
assignment4_2_fft_offset.c, which also outputted the real and imaginary 
components of the Fourier frequency components (done via fftw_plan_dft_r2c_1d). 
With all this, I was able to plot out the FFT of displaced pulse at x_0=0.5
as well as the power spectra of both displaced pulses. One thing to note about
the power spectra plots is that they do not completely align with the plots 
given in the book; that is, the size of the peaks are not the same. However,
the overall behavior (placement of peaks for both plots) mirror what is shown
in the book.
