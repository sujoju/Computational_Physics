Problem 2

Using the plot shown in assignment3_2.png, we find that the maximum range 
occurs around 40-45 degrees.

Problem 3

The analytical solution, denoted as sol(t), for this problem is given as follows:

theta_0 = 0.15
l = 1.0
Omega = sqrt(9.81/l)
sol(t) = theta_0*sin(Omega*t + pi/2)

Using the plot shown in assignment3_3_rk.png, we can see that rkO4 and rkO2
both give numerical solutions that are "very close" to the analytical solution;
by "very close," the relative error between the numerical solutions using 
rkO4 and rkO2 are essentially 0. However, the numerical solution using rkO2
deviates slightly more than the numerical solution using rkO4.

Problem 4

The analytical solution for our amplitude, denoted as theta_0, for this problem 
is given as follows:

l = 1.0
Omega = sqrt(9.81/l)
F_D = 0.2
theta_0 = F_D/sqrt((Omega**2-Omega_D**2)**2 + (q*Omega_D)**2)

Where we are scanning over Omega_D or q.
From the analytical solution above, we should expect resonance to occur 
when Omega_D = Omega, which we do see in our plot of Omega_D vs Max Amplitude.
Furthermore, at resonance, we should expect our analytical solution to behave
like 1/x since (Omega**2-Omega_D**2)**2 = 0. Again, we see this to be the 
case in our plot of Q vs Max Amplitude. In both plots, we see that the log
plots for both the analytical and measured data match quite well with each
other.
